Mood, motivation, focus and other cognitive functions are highly affected by inflammation in the body. Inflammation is a healing response of the body from damage that can be caused by various sources such as from pollution, but one of the biggest sources of damage to our bodies is from eating refined and processed foods, vegetable oils or eating a diet that is too high in sugar and carbohydrates. Excessive free radicals from the metabolization of these foods flood our system with reactive oxygen species which cause damage to our cell. By eating foods high in antioxidants such as vitamin C in broccoli, this help neutralize these free radicals from our system lowering damage to our cells and this reduces inflammation. This is why at the start of our guide, we emphasize removing these types of foods from our diet.</p><p>Also broccoli contains a good amount of fiber. Although this is not an essential nutrient, when eating carbohydrates, pick the ones that are paired with a significant amount of fiber. This will slow the absorption of carbohydrates into your bloodstream which help keep you blood sugar level stable. This in turn prevents the onset of post meal fatigue which brings about brain fog and and just general drowsiness.</p><p>Staying hydrated with a good mineral status is important in helping to maintain mental focus and general cognitive performance. Broccoli is mostly made up of water and is packaged with minerals that will improve your bodyâ€™s mineral status.</p><p>Remember that feeling you get from eating a big lunch?

Although broccoli has slightly more carbohydrates compared to other leafy vegetables such as arugula, a serving or 2 of this vegetable will pose no problem for your weight loss goals.

Broccoli, packaged with its vitamins and minerals make it worth while even though it is slightly higher in carbs than other vegetables.
