If you aren’t getting enough sunlight especially in the winter, then beef liver is a good way to get enough vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be linked with depressive symptoms which is why people get “winter blues”, from the lack of sunlight.</p><p>Beef liver is high in the amino acid tryptophan, which is the precursor your brain needs to form serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter which is responsible for us feeling in a good mood or the sense of well being.</p><p>Having your brain synthesizing and utilizing this neurotransmitter is essential to maintaining a good mood throughout the day. Beef liver are packed with B Vitamins which support the conversion of the amino acid tryptophan we get from protein to serotonin. In this process, Vitamin B6 is required for the conversion of tryptophan to serotonin and supplementing with more vitamin B6 has been shown to boost serotonin levels. Folate and Vitamin B12 are also involved in the reactions and must be present as well in order for the neurotransmitter to be produced. Also, when B3 deficient, tryptophan is converted into niacin instead of serotonin. Converting tryptophan into niacin is resource intensive, 60mg tryptophan makes 1mg niacin (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18271280\">r</a>), and requires iron, riboflavin and B6 to synthesize, so it is better to get it preformed from foods.</p><p>Beef liver is a rich source of all these mood supporting vitamins and so it is effective in helping you achieve this.</p>","id":"6ce9667a-0441-4f84-8f68-b9e11353580e"},{"type":"h2","value":{"align_center":false,"show_line":false,"tag":"","fa_icon":"","emoji":"","title":"Beef liver is great for weight loss- Eat Freely","emphasis":false},"id":"d4718e19-f0c9-4968-a957-2bb41acfafab"},{"type":"rich_text","value":"<p>Beef liver is high in protein while being low in fat and carb, providing you with the feeling of satiety while allowing your body to instead utilize its own fat stores which is ideal for weight loss.</p>","id":"e9750c5a-8ade-40c0-9915-9e9e116a9d1d"},{"type":"h2","value":{"align_center":false,"show_line":false,"tag":"","fa_icon":"","emoji":"","title":"Add beef liver to your meals to help you produce energy","emphasis":false},"id":"12b2cd2c-6635-4e18-8887-90ebc41275de"},{"type":"rich_text","value":"<p>Beef liver can be used to help provide you with extra B vitamins needed to produce energy.
