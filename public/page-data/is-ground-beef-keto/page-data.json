Some can be made in the human body but generally needs to be obtained from the diet as well because not enough is synthesized endogenously. Our body in order to create taurine endogenously requires methionine, cysteine amino acids and Vitamin B6.</p><p>In the human body, it acts as an antioxidant which is able to bind strong oxidants, helping prevent inflammation in the body.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18305447/\">r</a>)</p><p>It is also found in bile and makes it more potent which helps improve digestion of fat.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18305447\">r</a>)</p><p>A study shows that this may be an important nutrient which helps carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the insulin sensitivity of the tissues in our immune system, such as skin and other mucosal tissue that is exposed to bacteria and pathogens.

L-carnitine has been associated with various benefits including improved weight loss, improvements in brain function, heart health, exercise performance and reduction of depression symptoms. L-carnitine supplements suffer from low bioavailability of approximately 15-18%.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15761381\">r</a>) Therefore food sources of l-carnitine provide the best absorption in to the body.</p><p>Studies have shown in mice that, l-carnitine acts as an antioxidant protecting against oxidative stress.(<a href=\"http://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/journal/paperinfo?journalid=212&amp;doi=10.11648/j.avs.20150304.13\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26349760\">r</a>) It is also anti-inflammatory, helping lower inflammation in the body.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25701337\">r</a>) l-carnitine also chelates metal ions in the body which helps prevent cell damage from ingested and pollution sources.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15761381\">r</a>)</p><p>Another notable function on the human body and especially on the ketogenic diet is that l-carnitine helps with ketosis, to maintain the production of ketones in the body. A deficiency can cause hypoketonemia which is a state of low ketones in the body.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15761381\">r</a>)</p><p>There is approximately 157mg of l-carnitine in a 4 oz. serving of beef.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769838/\">r</a>)</p><h3>L-Carnosine</h3><p>L-Carnosine is a strong antioxidant(<a href=\"https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24285460\">r</a>) found in beef and is shown to increase the activity of glutathione to neutralize toxins in your blood and skin.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22125679\">r</a>) It can also work synergistically with Vitamin E to reduce oxidative stress.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22706107\">r</a>) In studies done on mice, it is also found that it may also be able to counteract consequences of oxidative stress and thus may have anti-aging properties.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29230838\">r</a>) L-Carnosine can also form complexes with unwanted metal ions in the body preventing them from damaging cells.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23442334\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24285460\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23442334\">r</a>)</p><p>Animal studies have also found that it may help mitigate toxicity of amyloid plaque which is implicated in people with alzheimer&#x27;s disease.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23442334\">r</a>)</p><p>In mice and human studies, l-carnosine has been found to reduce blood sugar levels, hba1c and blood pressure.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29420997\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26349760\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28744992\">r</a>)</p><p>You can find 424mg of l-carnosine in a single 4oz serving of beef loin.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769838/\">r</a>)</p><h3>Choline</h3><p>Choline is a conditionally essential nutrient for the human body since your body can produce it but doesn’t produce enough for everyday use. Deficiency is found in studies to be associated with many pathological conditions and diseases such as decreased energy production, fatty liver, hepatocyte death and skeletal muscle damage.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25010553/\">r</a>)</p><p>Choline acts as an antioxidant in the body and helps prevent inflammation. It may also affect the ketogenic diet as studies in mice have shown to reduce fat oxidation when fed a choline deficient diet.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25010553/\">r</a>)</p><p>A single 4 oz serving of beef contains approximately 75mg of choline. Recommended daily intake is 550 mg for men and 425 mg for women. (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769838/\">r</a>)</p><h3>Glutathione</h3><p>Glutathione is called the master antioxidant of the human body. It acts as our body’s main antioxidant defense. We produce this antioxidant endogenously and can acquire it from food intake. Eating a high protein diet also increases its production in the body.</p><p>Glutathione also boosts immune cells improving our capacity to fight bacteria and pathogens.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791752\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28853742\">r</a>)</p><p>A single 4oz serving of beef contains 20mg of glutathione.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769838/\">r</a>)</p><h3>Creatine</h3><p>Popularly it is known as a sports performance supplement, creatine is a conditionally essential nutrient which is found in high amounts in red meat including beef which usually accumulates in muscle meat. Creatine is a very well studied compound and is shown to accelerate increase in muscle mass and the force produced. It works by increasing our energy efficiency by recycling ATP, the molecule our cells use to produce energy. Our body can produce creatine endogenously, in our liver and kidneys.</p><p>Creatine has also been shown in studies to increase cognitive performance.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19773644\">r</a>) Early trials show that it has mood boosting action in the brain. (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450809\">r</a>)</p><p>A single serving of 4oz beef contains 500mg of creatine.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769838/\">r</a>)</p><h3>Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)</h3><p>CLA is a fatty acid found mainly in ruminant animal sourced foods such as beef. CLA is very well studied and known for its beneficial effect of enhancing breakdown and burning of fat in fat cells and muscles resulting in reduction of total fat mass and body weight.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434907\">r</a>)</p><p>CLA also has the beneficial effect of being anti-inflammatory, is shown in clinical trials in humans to lower blood pressure and protects LDL from oxidation in hamsters. (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25987426\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15778275/\">r</a>)</p><p>CLA can be found in beef at approximately 4.3mg per gram of fat.(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769838/\">r</a>)</p><h3>Coenzyme Q10</h3><p>Coenzyme Q10 is a conditionally essential nutrient found in beef that your body needs for energy production and is associated with many diseases when there is a deficiency. (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769838/\">r</a>) Coenzyme Q10 also works to help reduce blood pressure. (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17287847/\">r</a>)</p><p>It has unique properties as an antioxidant which not only helps protect membranes in the mitochondria, but it help regenerate other antioxidants such as Vitamin C and Vitamin E.(<a href=\"https://www.agriculturejournals.cz/web/cjfs.htm?volume=26&amp;firstPage=229&amp;type=publishedArticle\">r</a>)</p><p>A single serving of 4oz of beef contains approximately 4mg of Coenzyme Q10.
