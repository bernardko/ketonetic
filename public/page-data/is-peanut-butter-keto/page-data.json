Traditional peanut butter is made with just peanuts which is blended with a food processor until it is creamy. When you let blended peanuts sit, usually the oil will rise to the top, looking like a pool of oil at the top of the peanut butter. This is normal in traditional peanut butter. In order to make peanut butter smooth to prevent the oil from pooling at the top, manufacturers usually have to add oil to the mixture. This added oil is typically vegetable oil.</p><p>The best practice for keto diets is to avoid vegetable and seed oils because they are highly inflammatory to the body and can be harmful when eaten as a staple in your diet.

A study in mice found that polyunsaturated fats and endocannabinoid system may provide a clue to this. Peanuts are high in omega-6 polyunsaturated fats which are used in the body to synthesize endocannabinoids. Simply put, these in turn stimulate the need for food intake causing “munchies”, the feeling of hunger (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4285050/\">r</a>).</p><p>If you tend to overeat peanut butter, then it is best to avoid them until you have reached your target weight.
