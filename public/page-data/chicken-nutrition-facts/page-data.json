It has been associated with various benefits including improved weight loss, improvements in brain function, heart health, exercise performance and reduction of depression symptoms. The best source for carnitine is from food, as nutritional supplements suffer from low bioavailability. On a ketogenic diet, carnitine helps the body maintain production of ketones and a deficiency can lead to a state of hypoketonemia in which the body doesn’t produce enough ketones (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15761381-role-of-l-carnitine-in-metabolism-nutrition-and-therapy/\">r</a>).</p><h3>Taurine improves digestion of fats and immune function</h3><p>Taurine is a sulphur amino acid which our body can synthesize naturally but we are not able to make enough so dietary intake is beneficial. It acts as a strong antioxidant which prevent damage to our cells. Taurine also enhances the potency of bile which our digestive system uses to emulsify fats which allow us to digest and absorb them. Mechanistic studies in mice show taurine be an important nutrient for our immune system as it aids carbohydrate metabolism by increasing insulin sensitivity of skin and mucosal tissue in our gut which are areas that are exposed to bacteria and pathogens. Taurine is also famously known as one of the main ingredients in the energy drink Red Bull. </p><h3>Glutathione is the master antioxidant</h3><p>Glutathione is our body’s main antioxidant defence and is called the master antioxidant. Our body produces glutathione and we also obtain it from dietary intake. It is also used by the immune system to boost capacity to fight pathogens and bacteria. Increasing intake of protein from the diet also increases our body’s production of this antioxidant.</p><h3>Carnosine is a strong antioxidant with anti-aging potential</h3><p>Carnosine is also a strong antioxidant that works synergistically with glutathione and vitamin E to neutralize toxins in your blood and skin to reduce and counteract the consequences of  oxidative stress showing potential anti-aging properties (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29230838-carnosine-prevents-testicular-oxidative-stress-and-advanced-glycation-end-product-formation-in-d-galactose-induced-aged-rats/\">r</a>). </p><p>In the body, carnosine forms complexes with unwanted metal ions preventing them from damaging cells (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24285460/\">r</a>). </p><p>It has also been shown in mice and human studies to reduce blood sugar levels, hba1c and blood pressure (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29420997-l-carnosine-supplementation-attenuated-fasting-glucose-triglycerides-advanced-glycation-end-products-and-tumor-necrosis-factor-levels-in-patients-with-type-2-diabetes-a-double-blind-placebo-controlled-randomized-clinical-trial/\">r</a>).</p><h3>Choline may help maintain fat burning and reduce anxiety</h3><p>Choline is a conditionally essential nutrient and it acts as an antioxidant in the body.

Eating the cartilage from the thighs as well will add more collagen to your diet helping your joints recover from the stress of the training. The reason for eating higher protein is that it will result in higher fat loss, due to your body using more of its stores rather than from your dietary intake. Also fat is satiating, and that might be a disadvantage for bodybuilding as you want to eat the highest possible amount of protein for your meals so keeping the fat down will help you reach your protein intake levels.
