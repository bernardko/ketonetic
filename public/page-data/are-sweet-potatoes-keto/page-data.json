Anecdotally, this usually takes around 6 weeks to start feeling improved energy while on a keto diet and up to 6 months to get fully adapted, where you feel the same energy levels as utilizing carbohydrates as your primary energy source.</p><h3>Refill your muscle glycogen stores with sweet potatoes</h3><p>Sweet potatoes although not as fast absorbing as white rice or potatoes, are still a good source of carbs for filling up your muscle glycogen stores to give your workouts a bigger boost. Having your carbs 1-2 hours before your workout will be ideal to give your body time to digest and have the glucose ready in your circulation for use for your workout.</p><h3>Trypsin inhibitors may affect building muscle</h3><p>For people looking to maximize muscle building and lean body mass gains, then sweet potatoes may be a bad choice.
