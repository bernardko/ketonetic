A large egg contains 7 grams of protein and 5 grams of fat at 1.4:1 protein to fat ratio.</p><p>Eggs contain all four fat soluble vitamins A, D, E, K in the yolk of the egg which allows easy absorption into your body. Especially if you are in the northern hemisphere and not getting enough sunlight, eating eggs is a great way to top up your Vitamin D reserves. Most of the eggs nutrients is contained in the yolk, so make sure you eat the yolk!</p><p>Also as a good source of B vitamins, which are essential for your body to convert food into fuel it can use. Maintaining good levels of this water soluble vitamin also helps prevent mood issues.</p><h3>Choline</h3><p>Choline found in the egg yolk is the best food source of choline. It is a conditionally essential nutrient that your body is unable to produce enough of, so that you will need to obtain more through your diet. Choline is used in important functions within your body such as brain, liver, nervous system, brain and muscular function.</p><p>Choline is required for proper energy production and fuel metabolization in the body. In the mitochondria, it helps with the production of ATP, the energy currency of the body. Choline is also needed to burn fat, not having enough will not only leave you with low energy, it will also impact fat loss and may cause high anxiety(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25010553/\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19656836/\">r</a>).</p><p>Choline acts as an antiinflammatory, studies shown in humans show that a diet rich in choline had the lowest inflammatory markers in the body (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18258634/\">r</a>).</p><p>Choline deficiency is detrimental to the body and can result in fatty liver, liver cell death and muscle damage (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25010553/\">r</a>).</p><h3>Vitamin D</h3><p>Egg yolks are a good source of Vitamin D3 which is readily usable in the human body. Vitamin D is required for your body to absorb calcium in the small intestines (<a href=\"http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3405161/\">r</a>). It is harder to obtain through diet as most food do not contain Vitamin D and our primary source is from sunlight. However, relying on sunlight to get Vitamin D also has its difficulties in our modern society.</p><ol><li>UVB rays from the sun which comes in contact with our skin produces Vitamin D, but these rays don’t penetrate glass, so inside our homes or in our car, we aren’t producing much or any Vitamin D.</li><li>Sunscreen also effectively blocks out UVB rays.</li><li>if you have dark skin, it takes much longer exposure compared to light skin to produce Vitamin D</li></ol><p>Therefore, it is also essential that we try to obtain as much Vitamin D as possible through our diet or through supplementation.</p><p>A Vitamin D deficiency is also associated with depression and may be the reason why we get the “winter blues”. However, studies have not been able to show if this is the cause.</p><p>Beef liver is also an excellent source of Vitamin D.</p><h3>Retinol (Vitamin A)</h3><p>Retinol (Vitamin A) in eggs is already in its usable form which is great for your skin as it helps regenerate skin cells and for preventing eye diseases such as night blindness.</p><p>Studies in mice, show that retinol, both topical and in vivo show a dramatic improvement in skin damage repair and acts as an antioxidant to prevent damage (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6723309\">r</a>) .</p><p>Vitamin A toxicity is possible from too much intake, usually from supplemental sources and rarely from diet. This makes egg and ideal source as it contains a safe quantity to be significant but not cause toxicity.</p><p>Beef liver is also an excellent source of retinol.</p><h3>Selenium</h3><p>Selenium is an essential mineral which supports many functions in the body. It plays a role as an antioxidant allowing maximum usage of glutathione to neutralize free radicals preventing damage in the body from oxidative stress. The requirements of selenium increase the more energy we expend through exercise.</p>","id":"974fbb56-eac1-4b98-8ac3-867809698d4d"},{"type":"h2","value":{"align_center":false,"show_line":false,"tag":"","fa_icon":"","emoji":"","title":"Avidin: The antinutrient found in egg whites","emphasis":false},"id":"3d248810-03bf-4607-a8a8-320977922397"},{"type":"rich_text","value":"<p>Avidin is an antinutrient that is found in egg whites that bind to biotin and prevent us from absorbing it.
