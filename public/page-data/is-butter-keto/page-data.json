Although without the protein, it is quite nutritious, and is a good source of fat soluble vitamins. It is a good source of Vitamin A in the human usable for retinol and contains some in the form of beta-carotene which acts as an antioxidant in the body. Butter also contains Vitamin E, Vitamin D and Vitamin K. As these are fat soluble vitamins, eating them from a fat source such as butter aids its absorption into the body.</p><p>All dietary fats comes in a blend of different types of fatty acids which each of them have interesting properties and exert different effects on the body. Fatty acids serve both as structural components in the human body and as fuel to be converted into energy.</p><h3>Oleic Acid may improve cell membranes and helps weight loss</h3><p>Butter consists of around 32% oleic acid, highest compared to the other fatty acids. Oleic acid is the second most abundantly occurring fatty acid in the human body, next to palmitic acid.</p><p>Eating a diet of higher content of oleic acid upgrades your cardiolipin which is the membrane in your mitochondria and may improve its resistance to oxidative stress, reduces aging and cell death due to dysfunction. Studies in mice has found that oleic acid is incorporated and replaces fatty acids in your cells to make them more resilient (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3934163\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3273856/\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13678277\">r</a>).</p><p>In a study that has shown that oleic acid may have beneficial effects on body composition and weight loss. The fatty acid ethanolamide oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is increased in the body from the dietary intake of oleic acid is shown to stimulate lipolysis, which is the release of fat from fat cells, fat burning and improves satiety (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163782716300479\">r</a>).</p><h3>Stearic Acid may help weight loss</h3><p>Stearic acid is a long chain saturated fatty found in higher amounts in beef tallow, palm oil, cocoa butter, coconut oil and butter. Approximately 15% of butter is stearic acid.</p><p>The most interesting property it has is its ability to induce mitochondrial fusion in vivo in humans within 3 hours after ingestion (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6081440/\">r</a>). Simply put, what this means is that when this fat is ingested, it causes our body’s cells to burn fat. In mouse studies, it has been shown to reduce visceral fat (fat in the stomach area and organs) and increase lean body mass (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4164353/\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24286356\">r</a>).</p><h3>Palmitic Acid used abundantly in the body</h3><p>Butter consists of approximately 15% palmitic acid and it is the most abundantly found fat in humans, approximately making up 20-30% of all fat found in the body. It is the main type of fatty acid that is made inside the body using protein and glucose in a process called de novo lipogenesis (DNL) which is primarily done and regulated in the liver. Although this process happens in a very limited manner, usually only when carbohydrate intake exceeds the capacity in which the body is able to store it or when the diet is very low in fat and high in sugar to starch ratio (<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2017.00902/full\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11082210\">r</a>). However, relying on this synthesis may not be reliable in the long term and so obtaining it from diet is an easy solution.</p><p>Human breast milk is also a high source of palmitic acid and in particular, a specific type called beta-palmitate consisting of 60-80% found in studies. The palmitic acid found in butter also contains around 40% beta-palmitate. Beta-palmitate is found in studies of infant formula to be better digested by infants and improves absorption of calcium for them (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00223-012-9664-8\">r</a>).</p><h3>Myristic Acid may improve immune function and omega 3 levels</h3><p>Butter contains approximately 20% myristic acid and it is a long chain saturated fat that plays an important role in the immune system to allow its proper functioning. A rat study has found that increasing their myristic acid content also increases activation of macrophages which is a type of white blood cell (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8648429\">r</a>).</p><p>Studies in rats have shown that an increased dietary intake of myristic acid improves circulating, red blood cells, brain and tissue storage of omega-3 fats (<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/animal/article/substitution-of-dietary-oleic-acid-for-myristic-acid-increases-the-tissue-storage-of-linolenic-acid-and-the-concentration-of-docosahexaenoic-acid-in-the-brain-red-blood-cells-and-plasma-in-the-rat/7424911EEDE1E1A8B1A39FBF356C6B42\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26757835\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15936650\">r</a>)</p><h3>Lauric Acid is antiviral and antibacterial</h3><p>Lauric acid is a saturated fatty acid found in high quantity in coconut oil, but some is also found in butter, consisting of approximately 6%. It is well known for its antiviral (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8113756\">r</a>) and antibacterial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12033424\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12076524\">r</a>) properties, being able to deactivate various bacteria, yeast, fungi and viruses (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3491166\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3032090\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8113756\">r</a>). Monolaurin which is formed from lauric acid in the body also has a similar antimicrobial effect, but even more potent than its predecessor (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8021206\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3950450\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3772164\">r</a>).</p><h3>Butyric Acid may aid weight loss and satiety</h3><p>Named after butter, it is a good source of butyric acid containing around 3%. It is a short chained saturated fat and is also produced in the colon when fiber is broken down by gut flora. Colon cells use butyric acid as its primary energy source and it also helps with the production of gut mucosa which protects the gut lining from pathogens and toxins, as well as allowing the absorption of nutrients.</p><p>Studies in mice have found that there was a reduction in obesity and insulin resistance after dietary supplementation of butyrate (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19366864\">r</a>). Another study in mice also shows that butyrate stimulated the release of hormones in the gut which produced satiating effects (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22506074\">r</a>).</p>","id":"fd6105a0-8529-42a5-a02a-0b8be0041960"},{"type":"h2","value":{"align_center":false,"show_line":false,"tag":"","fa_icon":"","emoji":"","title":"Butter may improve weight loss","emphasis":false},"id":"955b5afa-0578-47a6-9c95-7db550673c45"},{"type":"rich_text","value":"<p>Butter has been the go-to fat for the ketogenic diet for weight loss and anecdotally has seen a lot of success.
