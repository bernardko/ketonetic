The diet puts your body into a state of ketosis, where your liver metabolizes fat into ketones for your body to use for fuel. In order to achieve the state of ketosis, you lower your intake of sugar and carbohydrates that digest into sugars in the body to less than 5% of your daily caloric intake. This generally averages to about from 0 to 25g of carbohydrates per day. How it works is that your body regulates fat oxidation via your blood glucose levels using insulin. When you intake excessive carbohydrates, your body increases insulin production which then prevents fat oxidation, instead storing them into your fat cells. When you keep your carbohydrate intake low, this reverses this process allowing your body to use the fat stored in your body instead for energy.</p>","id":"c69b7939-8aa4-4e58-beaf-65f164a6d28f"},{"type":"h2","value":{"align_center":false,"show_line":false,"tag":"","fa_icon":"","emoji":"","title":"What are the benefits of the Keto diet?","emphasis":false},"id":"5f695894-dc24-4be9-8bd2-7260ea90e108"},{"type":"rich_text","value":"<p>This diet has been proven to be very effective for weight loss since it optimizes your body to maximize fat burning.

Not always thinking about food will definitely help improve your focus. Consuming sufficient protein also provides the body with enough amino acids to produce neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine which will reduce anxiety, improve mood and motivation.</p><h3>Sufficient mineral intake reduces cravings</h3><p>Those strong cravings for snacking or sometimes hunger when you already ate come from your body signalling that it is missing some minerals. Making sure that you eat foods that provide these minerals will remove these distracting cravings.</p><h3>Low carbohydrate diets keeps your blood sugar stable</h3><p>When you eat a high amount of carbohydrates or sugar, your body must release a high amount of insulin to remove the incoming blood sugar. Usually, your body will overcompensate causing too much blood sugar to be removed. You will experience this when you feel “food coma” or drowsiness after eating a meal high in carbohydrates.</p><p>When you eat low amount or even no carbohydrates, your blood sugar remains stable. This allows your liver through gluconeogenesis to produce all the glucose needed by your body and thus preventing the accompanying blood sugar roller coaster and drowsiness that comes with it. Ketones produced by your body will provide your body with stable energy levels all day without the brain fog.</p><h3>Avoid carbohydrates in liquid form</h3><p>Carbohydrates in liquid form absorb into the bloodstream very rapidly and even smaller amounts will have a drastic effect on your blood sugar levels which tends to keep it elevated your for longer and will make you feel hungry very quickly due to the compensating insulin spike to deal with the rapidly rising blood sugar. Many condiments such as ketchup are high in sugar, oatmeal and beer are examples of this.</p>","id":"1387d7d7-560a-44b9-b053-3325828f4c7f"}]},"content":[{},{}]},{"__typename":"Wagtail_ColumnBlock","blockType":"column","value":{"columns":1,"content":[{"type":"h2","value":{"align_center":true,"show_line":true,"tag":"","fa_icon":"","emoji":"","title":"Best Practices and Tips on Keto Diet for Weight Loss","emphasis":false},"id":"77a3b000-db18-4391-b1b0-5f584da890ce"},{"type":"rich_text","value":"<p>How the body becomes able to sustainably use fat for fuel is keeping it in a state of metabolic flexibility.
