In response to this, your body will have to release a higher amount of insulin to handle the blood sugar spike.

Low carb diets are generally under 100 grams of carbohydrates a day and so bananas are okay to consume, but the following tips can definitely help.</p><ol><li>Eat bananas around your workout schedule. High intensity exercise increases the insulin sensitivity of your muscles and due to depleting the glycogen stored in them. Carbohydrates eaten around exercise will generally be used to replenish liver and muscle glycogen stores and will be quickly taken up by your muscles. This reduces the amount of insulin your body will have to produce since your muscles will quickly respond to it and take up the excess glucose.</li><li>Take a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water before eating the banana. Studies show that vinegar taken before the carbohydrate ingestion will reduce the blood sugar and insulin spike.
