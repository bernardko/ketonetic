Habitual drinkers of 1-5 cups per day has been associated with 15% reduced risk of cardiovascular disease in healthy people and people who have already suffered a cardiovascular disease event, habitual consumption does not increase the risk of a recurrent event or death (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29276945\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16685044\">r</a>).</p><p>Both coffee and decaffeinated coffee has been shown in mice to activate autophagy one to four hours after consumption. Autophagy meaning “to eat itself” is the process in which cells in the body recycle damaged cell parts by breaking them down back into protein components for reuse. This process is an important process for preventing disease and is a field of active research especially due to its impact and potential to the aging process(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4111762/\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4111691/\">r</a>).</p>","id":"b1fdeff5-2b93-4e86-aa64-469975f1aef6"},{"type":"h2","value":{"align_center":false,"show_line":false,"tag":"","fa_icon":"","emoji":"","title":"Coffee Health Risks and Disadvantages","emphasis":false},"id":"67fab79c-0cb3-45ef-bad1-58e7e109b91c"},{"type":"rich_text","value":"<p>All plant foods contain some level of phytic acid which includes coffee (<a href=\"https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/vegetarianism-and-plant-foods/living-with-phytic-acid/\">r</a>). The main disadvantage of phytic acid is that it binds to minerals, particularly iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium and prevents us from absorbing it. However this is on a per meal basis and not throughout the day and so we can minimize this by drinking our coffee separately from our meals.</p><p>Coffee also contains oxalates which is a compound also found in many plant foods. In high concentrations, oxalates are toxic and is used by plants as a natural pesticide against predators and pests. Our gut can neutralize a certain amount of oxalate and our body has ways of excreting oxalates as well such as through the skin. Ingestion of too much oxalates in our diet can lead to kidney stones and accumulation in other organs as well such as our thyroid in the form of crystals. Oxalates also binds strongly to minerals and prevents our body from using it.</p><p>A cup of coffee, depending on the kind of coffee can contain 45mg to 123mg of oxalates (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22642066\">r</a>). Instant coffee contain higher amounts of oxalates than brewed coffee (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25358189\">r</a>).</p><p>The caffeine in coffee acts as a diuretic causing your body to pass urination. Although this may not mean that you become dehydrated due to the loss of liquid as the coffee drink itself contains water, it can cause a loss of minerals in your body. This effect should be minimal in decaf coffee as almost all the caffeine has been removed.</p><p>Caffeine also has an effect on blood pressure and people with uncontrolled blood pressure should not consume high doses of caffeine (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29276945\">r</a>).</p>","id":"84770c67-7dbc-4b2e-8826-db050f7e89a5"},{"type":"h2","value":{"align_center":false,"show_line":false,"tag":"","fa_icon":"","emoji":"","title":"Carbs in Coffee","emphasis":false},"id":"9c73fee8-204f-4865-aca4-4f5cd350b78e"},{"type":"rich_text","value":"<p>A cup of black coffee brewed from grounds contains zero net carbs and is keto friendly.</p>","id":"a595f42b-220f-4fc9-a2bd-6b95e338f397"},{"type":"h2","value":{"align_center":false,"show_line":false,"tag":"","fa_icon":"","emoji":"","title":"Coffee on Keto","emphasis":false},"id":"5f5c1500-77bc-4b4a-85bc-0318d269d97c"},{"type":"rich_text","value":"<p>Coffee is an excellent drink on the ketogenic diet.
