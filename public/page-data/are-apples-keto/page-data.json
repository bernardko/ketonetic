In epidemiological studies, fructose is associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity. Excessive consumption of fructose can increase the production of uric acid which is a driver of gout, increase the permeability of the gut, cause high blood pressure, increase liver inflammation and cause accumulation of fat in the liver and stomach area (visceral fat) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26429086\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26567197\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25965509\">r</a>).</p><p>For healthy people, fructose shouldn’t pose a problem. In a study of healthy individuals, ingestion of a high dose of fructose for 8 weeks didn’t show any adverse results. However, in the study, patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease had increased fat accumulation in the liver and stomach area (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31796953\">r</a>).</p><p>People with health problems mentioned above should track their fructose intake. According to a study in 2018, in theory, eating a fructose load under 5 grams may help since it is fully metabolized in the small intestines and doesn’t reach the liver (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mangan150/status/1172986514344534016\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413118301244\">r</a>).</p><h3>Pesticides are found the pulp of the apple</h3><p>Apples after harvest usually take some time before they show up in retail supermarket due to supply chain logistics. In order to keep them from browning, apples go through drench treatment in a pesticide called diphenylamine (DPA) and is toxic at high doses and can affect the production of red blood cells. Also DPA has been shown to penetrate the skin into the pulp of the apple and so washing or removing the peel of the apple will not fully prevent ingestion. (<a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/1923936/are-apples-health-risk\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphenylamine\">r</a>)</p><h3>Eating apple may damage your teeth</h3><p>According to a study published in the Journal of Dentistry, the higher acidity and sugar content found in apples and other fruits may damage tooth enamel (<a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/44686-apple-nutrition-facts.html\">r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300571211002107\">r</a>). So it is recommended to rinse your mouth after eating acidic foods to minimize damage.</p><h3>Don’t eat the apple seeds</h3><p>Apple seeds which are generally discarded contain cyanogenic glycosides which are poisonous. Although our body is able to deal with a small amount of cyanide, at a certain dose it becomes toxic. According to <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/are-apple-seeds-poisonous#lethal-dose\">Healthline</a>, eating around it takes around 200 apple seeds or 40 cores to ingest the fatal dose.</p>","id":"efa0f19b-61a4-4466-af06-c7ffa60f91d1"},{"type":"h2","value":{"align_center":false,"show_line":false,"tag":"","fa_icon":"","emoji":"","title":"Are Apples Keto?","emphasis":false},"id":"381fcb84-4269-4c36-8fe0-0784d8964b87"},{"type":"rich_text","value":"<p>The focus of the ketogenic diet is the intake of human essential protein, fats, vitamins and minerals.

A medium apple contains only 0.2 grams of fat and 0.4 grams of protein.</p><p>Apples contain low amounts of vitamins and minerals. The most notable nutrients apple contains are Vitamin C and potassium. However, Vitamin C and glucose compete for uptake in the human body with glucose having higher priority. Since apples are high in glucose, you may not be able to absorb the Vitamin C contained in apples.</p><h3>Pectin Prebiotic Fiber</h3><p>Pectin acts as a prebiotic fiber in human nutrition and it is mainly found in plants which function as a structural component of plant cell walls. Although we cannot digest it, it will end up being fermented by our gut bacteria to produce butyrate, a short chain fatty acid which has anti-inflammatory properties. It is the primary fuel used by our intestinal cells helping with the production of mucus to protect the intestinal wall.</p><h3>Antioxidants in Apple</h3><p>Apples contain many polyphenols which are considered to be providing the benefits from apples. Laboratory in vitro (cell culture) studies show that compounds such as beta-carotene, quercetin and chlorogenic acid found in apples acts as strong antioxidants and may help bolster the antioxidant system in the body.</p><p>Beta-carotene acts mainly as an antioxidant in our body able to neutralize 2 types of free radicals in our body. We also have a small capacity to convert 0-8% this compound into Vitamin A. Note that some people are not able to do this. (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC442131/\">r</a>)</p><p>Quercetin found exclusively in the peel of the apple also acts as an antioxidant and is found to inhibit various kinds of tumor growth in breast, colon and intestines. Low levels of quercetin was also found to inhibit platelet aggregation and mobilize calcium which may help in cardiovascular disease.
