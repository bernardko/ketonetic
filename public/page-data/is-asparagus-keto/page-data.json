Fiber in vegetables binds carbohydrates making them release slowly in our digestion which help maintain stable blood sugars and will help minimize the release of insulin from your pancreas after your meal. On a ketogenic diet, this will keep your body in a metabolically flexible state, being able to continue to use both glucose and fats as an energy source. In this state, your body will focus on using fats for general activities and use glucose on high intensity activities. Your liver will also continue to produce as much glucose as needed by your body through gluconeogenesis. The fiber in the vegetables will help you feel satiated and provides a small benefit by feeding your gut bacteria which can help you produce some beneficial and essential nutrients such as certain B vitamins and short chain fatty acids which is beneficial for your gut lining.</p>","id":"01ff7e8d-919f-4cbc-bf06-b9c00dea2507"},{"type":"h2","value":{"align_center":false,"show_line":false,"tag":"","fa_icon":"","emoji":"","title":"How can asparagus help improve your mental clarity?","emphasis":false},"id":"168657f0-c1f3-4883-8ef7-b3d976c4d150"},{"type":"rich_text","value":"<p>Eating high fiber foods have the benefit of helping slow down the absorption of carbohydrates into the bloodstream.

Asparagus also contains Vitamin C and Vitamin E which are antioxidants which help lower and prevent inflammation in the body, improving your sense of well being and mood.

Eating processed foods, sugar and alcohol can cause inflammation in the body and so having enough antioxidants to counter the effects are important if you are planning to have a delicious dessert after your meal. Of course, minimizing your intake of these would be optimal.</p><p>Other notable nutrients found in asparagus are choline, Vitamin B1, B2, B5 and B6.
